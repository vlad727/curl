curl -I # get only status code
curl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.15.tar.gz # download files
curl -v telnet://127.0.0.1:22 # check port 22  response result if it open and works "Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 22 (#0) and  SSH-2 OpenSSH_7.9" or  closed "Connection refused"
curl  -u admin:12345 --basic http://127.0.0.1:808 ### get with basic authorization 

example:
curl 10.0.0.1:12345
We can expect one of the following three different outcomes:

If curl exits immediately with the error
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 10.0.0.1 port 12345: Connection refused
then we know that the port is closed and no application is listening on it.

If curl exits immediately without any error, or with an error such as
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
then we know that an application accepted the connection from curl, and either sent some content back to curl, or was confused by what curl sent it and closed the connection. In either case, we know the port is open with something listening on it.

If curl hangs for a few minutes (typically 3 minutes) and then exits with
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 10.0.0.1 port 12345: Connection timed out
then we know that the port is not reachable from where we are running curl. This is most likely because of a firewall rule silently blocking our connection attempts, or perhaps a routing problem. In this case, we cannot determine the status of the port because we cannot even reach it.
